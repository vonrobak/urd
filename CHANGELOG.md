## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-05

### Added
- Compressed send pass-through: auto-detects `--compressed-data` support (btrfs-progs 5.18+) and enables protocol v2 sends — less CPU, preserves compression on destination
- Post-delete sync: `btrfs subvolume sync` after each retention delete ensures freed space is visible to the space check before the next snapshot
- Context-aware suggestions: `urd doctor`, `urd status`, and bare `urd` now show specific commands based on chain health, drive state, and subvolume config instead of static "run `urd backup`" advice
- Sentinel config reload: daemon detects config file changes via mtime polling and hot-reloads without restart
- Token-aware chain-break gate: verified drives proceed with full sends in auto mode, breaking the deadlock where broken chains permanently blocked transient subvolumes
- `send_completed` field in heartbeat (schema v2): distinguishes "backup ran successfully" from "data actually reached an external drive"
- `SendType::Deferred` (Prometheus metric value 3): distinguishes intentional no-send from blocked-by-gate deferral
- Deferred synthesis in backup summary: subvolumes with no local snapshots to send now surface actionable guidance instead of silent skips
- `SkipCategory::NoSnapshotsAvailable` for structured classification of send-blocked skips
- External-only runtime: subvolumes with `local_snapshots = false` no longer show false "degraded" health or "broken chain" warnings — status table shows em-dash for LOCAL and "ext-only" for THREAD, plan output uses `[EXT]` skip tag
- Skip unchanged subvolumes: compares BTRFS generation counters to avoid creating identical snapshots for quiet subvolumes — shown as `[SAME]` in plan output with elapsed time, overrideable via `--force-snapshot`
- `urd emergency` command: guided emergency space recovery — assesses snapshot roots, previews aggressive thinning (keep latest + pinned only), executes with confirmation
- Automatic emergency pre-flight: backup command detects critically low space (<50% of `min_free_bytes`) and runs emergency retention under the advisory lock before planning
- Doctor space trend warning: `urd doctor` warns when snapshot roots approach free-space thresholds, suggests `urd emergency`
- Shared pin re-check helper (`chain::is_pinned_at_delete_time`): single implementation of ADR-106 defense-in-depth layer 3, used by executor and emergency paths

### Fixed
- False "all chains broke simultaneously" anomaly when a drive disconnects (total=0 was treated as all-broken)
- Duplicate default config path logic in `urd migrate` consolidated to single implementation

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `local_snapshots = false` in v1 config — replaces `local_retention = "transient"` with a clear boolean opt-out of local snapshot history
- `urd migrate` command — transforms legacy config to v1 schema with backup, dry-run, and semantic equivalence (no behavioral changes)
- V1 example config at `config/urd.toml.v1.example`
- Serialize support on all config types — enables `urd migrate` and config round-tripping
- V1 config schema parser with `config_version = 1` dispatch — self-describing subvolumes, no `[defaults]`/`[local_snapshots]` sections
- V1 validation: named protection levels reject operational overrides, enforce drive requirements
- `snapshot_root` and `min_free_bytes` fields on `ResolvedSubvolume` — eliminates per-call Config lookups in planner and awareness

### Fixed
- `urd migrate` partial retention overrides on named levels now bake all four fields (hourly/daily/weekly/monthly) — previously, unspecified fields silently inherited from v1 synthesized defaults instead of the derived level's values

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Protection level vocabulary: guarded→recorded, protected→sheltered, resilient→fortified — names now describe what the data *becomes*, not a generic safety adjective
- ADR-111 revised with complete v1 schema specification, field tables, migration spec, and validation error messages
- ADR-110 updated with new level names and implementation gate progress

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added
- `urd drives` subcommand — list configured drives with status, token state, free space, and role
- `urd drives adopt <label>` — accept a drive into Urd's identity system (reset token relationship)
- Drive reconnection notifications via Sentinel — desktop alert when an absent drive returns
- Identity-aware reconnection: drives with token issues get "needs adoption" notification instead of false "all clear"

### Changed
- TokenExpectedButMissing error messages now direct users to `urd drives adopt` instead of `urd doctor`

## [0.8.2] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Safety gate (chain-break full send blocked) now reports `DEFERRED` instead of `FAILED` — the tool made a correct decision, not an error
- Deferred-only backup runs report "success" instead of "failure" in summary, heartbeat, and metrics
- `urd doctor --thorough` stale-pin message changed from accusatory "sends may be failing" to neutral "last successful send was N day(s) ago"
- `urd doctor` no longer suggests adding a UUID that's already configured on another drive (cloned drive scenario)

## [0.8.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- `urd status` no longer shows false degradation for subvolumes scoped to specific drives (assess ignored per-subvolume `drives` field)
- Cloned or swapped drives with missing identity tokens are now blocked from receiving sends (TokenExpectedButMissing safety gate)

### Changed
- Local-only subvolumes (`send_enabled = false`) display as `[LOCAL]` instead of `[OFF] Disabled` in plan output
- Local-only subvolumes suppressed from backup summary skip section (they're complete, not skipped)
- `urd plan` and `urd backup --dry-run` show `[WARNING]` for drives with token identity issues

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-02

### Added
- `/steve` skill: Steve Jobs product vision and UX quality gatekeeper — reviews brainstorms, designs, and finished features from the user's perspective
- `urd backup` now acts immediately — fresh snapshots and sends without waiting for intervals. Automated runs use `--auto` to respect interval gating.
- Pre-action briefing shown before manual backups: "Backing up everything to WD-18TB. 7 snapshots, 7 sends, ~53.0GB"
- Mode-aware empty-plan messages explain why nothing was backed up and suggest fixes

### Changed
- `urd plan` shows the manual (no-interval) view by default; `urd plan --auto` shows the timer view
- Lock trigger string changed from "timer" to "auto"/"manual" for clearer diagnostics

## [0.7.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Btrfs receive stdout ("At snapshot ...") no longer leaks into terminal during sends
- Backup progress display: completion lines now print synchronously from executor, fixing race where wrong subvolume names and missing completions appeared for fast sends
- `[preflight]` internal prefix removed from user-facing backup warnings

### Changed
- Default command: "All sealed." → "All connected drives are sealed." with health degradation surfacing
- Status table: PROTECTION column hidden unless exposure conflicts with promise; disconnected drive columns collapsed; RECOVERY column hidden (showed policy, not actual depth)
- Backup skipped section: only absent drives and actionable skips shown; [WAIT] and [OFF] suppressed
- Doctor warnings include concrete numbers (e.g., "snapshot_interval (1w) exceeds guarded requirement (1d)") with fix suggestions
- UUID missing warning moved from runtime log to `urd doctor` check
- Log output (WARN level) suppressed on interactive TTY; structured presentation layer handles all user-facing warnings

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Staleness escalation: disconnected drives show graduated urgency text based on awareness promise status (PROTECTED → minimal, AT RISK → "consider connecting", UNPROTECTED → "protection degrading")
- Next-action suggestions: context-specific dimmed hints after `urd status`, `urd plan`, `urd backup`, `urd verify`, and bare `urd` (silence when healthy)
- Structured redundancy advisory system: detects no-offsite-protection, offsite-drive-stale (>30 days), single-point-of-failure, and transient-no-local-recovery gaps
- REDUNDANCY section in `urd status` with per-advisory observation and suggestion
- `advisory_summary` field in sentinel state file (schema v3) for Spindle tray icon integration
- `urd retention-preview` command: shows recovery windows, disk estimates, and transient/graduated comparison for retention policies
- RECOVERY column in `urd status` table showing compact retention summary per subvolume (e.g., "31d / 7mo / ∞")
- `urd doctor` command: unified health check composing config, infrastructure, awareness, sentinel, and optional thread verification (`--thorough`)
- Mythic voice on backup transitions: brief event-aware lines when threads are mended, first sends established, promises recovered, or all subvolumes reach sealed

### Changed
- Offsite cycling advisory migrated from stringly-typed 7-day threshold to structured `OffsiteDriveStale` with 30-day threshold

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-01

### Added
- Bare `urd` (no subcommand) shows a one-sentence status: "All sealed. Last backup 7h ago." or "3 of 9 sealed. htpc-root exposed." First-time users see setup guidance instead of help text
- `urd completions <shell>` generates tab-completion scripts for bash, zsh, fish, elvish, and powershell
- `StateDb::last_run_info()` shared helper for building presentation-ready last-run summaries
- Transient immediate cleanup: executor deletes old pin parent immediately after successful send to all drives, reducing local snapshot count from two to one between runs
- `Config::drive_labels()` helper for collecting configured drive labels
- Promise redundancy encoding: resilient protection level now requires at least one offsite-role drive and degrades promise status when the offsite copy goes stale (30/90-day thresholds)
- Preflight check `resilient-without-offsite` warns when resilient subvolume lacks an offsite drive
- Offsite drive role shown as "(offsite)" annotation in `urd status` table column headers
- `DriveRole` plumbed through `DriveAssessment`, `StatusDriveAssessment`, `DriveInfo`, and `InitDriveStatus`

### Changed
- Vocabulary overhaul: safety labels are now sealed/waning/exposed, chain→thread, mounted→connected/disconnected/away, SAFETY→EXPOSURE, CHAIN→THREAD, PROMISE→PROTECTION column headers
- CLI command descriptions rewritten to intent-first language (e.g., "Check whether your data is safe")
- Summary line now differentiates exposure levels: "htpc-root exposed. docs waning." instead of generic "needs attention"
- Skip tags differentiated by category: [WAIT], [AWAY], [SPACE], [OFF], [SKIP] replace overloaded [SKIP]
- Drive status is now role-aware: offsite drives show "away" when disconnected, primary drives show "disconnected"
- Notification mythology cleaned up: loom/weave→spindle/thread, rewoven→mended, unguarded→exposed
- `UrdError::Chain` error message changed from "Chain error" to "Thread error" (log grep patterns may need updating)

### Fixed
- 7-day "consider cycling" advisory now scoped to offsite-role drives only (previously fired for all unmounted drives)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Transient local retention mode (`local_retention = "transient"`): delete local snapshots after external send, keep only pinned chain parents for incremental sends
- Preflight checks for transient misconfiguration (transient without send, transient with named protection level)

### Fixed
- Awareness model now understands transient retention: local status defers to external send freshness instead of falsely reporting UNPROTECTED

## [0.4.3] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Sentinel tracks health transitions and fires HealthDegraded/HealthRecovered notifications
- `visual_state` block in sentinel-state.json: icon state and safety/health counts for tray icon consumers
- Per-subvolume health and health_reasons in sentinel state file promise states
- Sentinel state file schema version 2 (backward-compatible with v1)

### Changed
- Generic `NamedSnapshot` trait replaces duplicated change-detection logic for promise and health axes
- All-blocked health escalates to Critical icon (was Warning)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Sentinel detects simultaneous chain breaks on a drive and notifies (hardware swap signal)
- `FullSendReason` annotation on full sends: `first send`, `chain broken`, or `no pin`
- Full-send gate in autonomous mode: chain-break sends are blocked unless `--force-full` is passed
- Drive token verification wired into backup path (filters sends to token-mismatched drives)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-30

### Added
- Rich progress display during backup: subvolume name, send counter, completion trail, and ETA for full sends
- Estimated send sizes in `urd plan` output with three-tier fallback (same-drive > cross-drive > calibrated)
- Qualified summary totals: `"6 sends (~623 GB total)"` or `"estimated for 4 of 6"` when partial
- Cross-drive fallback for send size estimation (covers drive swap scenarios)
- Structural headings in `urd plan` output (operations and skipped sections)
- Collapsed skip reasons: grouped by category instead of 20+ individual lines
- `SkipCategory` enum with structured classification in JSON daemon output

### Fixed
- Planner space check now uses cross-drive fallback (previously only same-drive history)

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added
- Drive session tokens for hardware swap detection (`.urd-drive-token` identity files)
- Chain health computation in awareness model (incremental chain intact/broken per drive)
- Two-axis status display: data safety (OK/aging/gap) + operational health (healthy/degraded/blocked)
- Temporal context in status table: snapshot counts show age (e.g., "47 (30m)", "12 (2h)")
- Unmounted drives shown as "away" in status table when they have send history
- Notification deduplication: backup defers to sentinel when daemon is running
- Drive connection recording in SQLite (mount/unmount events with typed enums)

### Changed
- README rewritten for public repository
- Status command derives chain health from awareness assessment instead of recomputing
- `SentinelStateFile::read()` moved from output.rs to sentinel_runner.rs (ADR-108)
- Sentinel initial assessment log differentiates missing heartbeat (first-run)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- Sentinel daemon: pure state machine with event-driven transitions and circuit breaker
- Sentinel I/O runner and `urd sentinel` CLI command
- Protection promise model (ADR-110): typed promise levels with derivation function
- Notification dispatcher with promise-state-driven alerts
- Awareness model: pure function computing promise states per subvolume
- Heartbeat file: JSON health signal written after every backup run
- Presentation layer: structured output with interactive/daemon rendering and mythic voice
- `urd get` command for file restore from snapshots
- UUID drive fingerprinting: verify drive identity before sending snapshots
- Post-backup structured summary and local space guard
- Pre-flight config consistency checks
- Structured error types with actionable btrfs error translation
- Lock extraction module with shared advisory locking

### Changed
- Voice migration initiated: presentation logic moving to voice.rs
- Config system design review and ADR suite update (ADR-110, ADR-111)

### Fixed
- Pre-cutover hardening: mkdir before btrfs receive, legacy pin file accuracy
- Space estimation queries drive mount path instead of per-subvolume directory
- Phase 4 adversary review findings addressed
